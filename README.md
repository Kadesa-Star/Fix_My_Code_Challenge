This is all about jumping into existing code,
fixing some areas so as it works efficiently

In this instance, we are fixing FizzBuzz.

* More about FizzBuzz
It involves printing a sequence of numbers from 1 to n but with a twist
- For numbers that are multiples of 3, print "Fizz" instead of the number
- For numbers that are multiples of %, print "Buzz" instead of the number
- For numbers that are multiples of both 3 and %, print "FizzBuzz" instead of the number
